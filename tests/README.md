## Test Suite Developer Notes

### Running the Tests
Navigate to the root of the project and use the `pytest` command to run the tests.

### Preparing the Test Files
The test files used in `test_download_extract_data.py` were generated by running the script `generate_test_files.py` from the `tests` directory.   

In order for the tests to pass, the test files must exist in the remote GitHub repository.   

Should the test files disappear from the remote repository for some reason, they can be regenerated by running `generate_test_files.py` from the `tests` directory again, and then pushing the test files to the remote repository.   

### Test Teardown
The `conftest.py` script contains code that removes any files or directories created during the tests that require deletion at the end of the session.
