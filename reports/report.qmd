# Summary

This study employing a linear regression model to predict wildfire intensity in Australian regions aims to 
draw parallels with British Columbia's escalating wildfire risk due to climate-related weather. Using a 
dataset encompassing fire-related variables since 2005, including fire area, brightness, and radiative 
power, the analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between fire area and mean radiative power. The 
model demonstrates good fit and offers potential applications in wildfire management and prediction.

# Introduction

British Columbia is well-known for having a moderate climate associated with its beautiful, temperate 
rainforests; but in recent years, climate-related weather extremes in the region have caused a significant
increase in forest fires [@dellaSala2011; @parisien2023]. The rapid onset of the problem, in conjunction 
with its unprecedented magnitude, has left British Columbians vulnerable as provincial authorities struggle 
to develop infrastructure capable of addressing the frequency and severity of the fires [@parisien2023]. 
While inland residents face a heightened risk of losing their lives, homes, and loved ones to wildfires, 
the resulting smoke influences air quality throughout the province, posing profound health risks 
[@cascio2018].

While rates of climate-related fire events are projected to increase globally, due to the composition of its 
ecological landscape, Australia is a nation that is well accustomed to battling wildfires [@jones2022; 
@bowman2018]. There is notable overlap between the terrestrial biomes present in both Australia and B.C., 
particularly in the unique temperate coastal regions steeped with flammable vegetation, and the semi-arid 
inland deserts [@dickman2018; @bowman2018]. Given its proximity to the equator, Australia’s North coast 
exhibits fewer similarities to B.C [@dickman2018; @dellaSala2011]. However, a shift in the B.C. climate 
precipitated by rising temperatures is occurring; some of the drier inland areas are beginning to mimic the 
ecological conditions found on Australia’s North coast.

Here, we attempt to predict the intensity of wildfires in regions across Australia that exhibit ecological 
similarities to B.C. in the hopes that the model can be adapted for provincial use. The four highest 
temperatures over the last century in B.C. have all been recorded within the last seven years; the swiftness 
with which the local climate is changing has caused a scarcity of regional data to anticipate the state of 
future wildfire seasons [@parisien2023]. We will be using a 
[dataset](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/Spot-Challenge-Wildfires/raw/main/data/Nov_10.zip) processed by 
IBM containing information collected via thermal imaging technology since 2005, which captures a number of 
variables such as region, daily sum of estimated fire area, brightness, and radiative power [@hamann2021; 
@krook2021]. For the purposes of this analysis, fire intensity will be represented by estimated daily 
regional area affected by fire. The rarity of the terrestrial biomes shared by both regions, coupled with 
Australia’s experience in wildfire management, present B.C. with an unlikely learning opportunity: it is 
possible that the wealth of historical data on Australian wildfires could be used to help B.C. predict 
forest fire intensity [@bowman2018; @dellaSala2011]. A sentiment that has been shared among Canadian 
researchers is that the abilities of machine learning tools are not taken advantage of by the Canadian 
Wildland Fire Information System [@purcell2023]. Current wildfire research efforts should be supplemented 
by modern technological methods; hopefully, they can be used to preempt the trajectory of wildfire 
prevalence, and make life-saving modifications to infrastructure. 

# Methods

## Data 

Our dataset contains information about wildfires throughout seven geographic regions in Australia, 
starting from the year 2005. It can be located in its entirety 
[on GitHub](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/Spot-Challenge-Wildfires/tree/main), and 
[this](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/Spot-Challenge-Wildfires/blob/main/data/misc/NSW_Wildfires_Temperature.csv) 
is the specific csv containing the data used for our analysis [@hamann2021; @krook2021].

There are 26,404 rows and 9 columns. Definitions for each variable, obtained from the 
[original data documentation](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/Spot-Challenge-Wildfires/blob/main/data/Readme_Docs_Wildfires-Datasets_2020-11.pdf), are provided below.

- `Region`: The respective regions as outlined above for which the data was/is aggregated.
- `Date` Day of acquisition of the data. All dates are in UTC and provide the data for 24 hours ahead.
- `Estimated_fire_area`: Daily sum of estimated fire area for presumed vegetation fires with a 
confidence level of larger than 75% for a given region. To obtain this estimated area the scan pixel 
size was multiplied by the along track pixel size. The nominal unit for the area is in kmA^2^.
- `Mean_estimated_fire_brightness`: Daily mean (by flagged fire pixels(=count)) of estimated fire 
brightness for presumed vegetation fires with a confidence level of larger than 75% for a given 
region. The data was obtained by averaging the means of both the brightness temperature 21 (obtained 
from channel 21/22) and brightness temperature 31 (obtained from channel 31). The units are in Kelvin.
- `Mean_estimated_fire_radiative_power`: Daily mean (by flagged fire pixels(=count)) of estimated 
radiative power for presumed vegetation fires with a confidence level of larger than 75% for a given 
region. The units are in megawatts.
- `Mean_confidence`: Daily mean of confidence for presumed vegetation fires with a confidence level of 
larger than 75% for a given region. This value is based on a collection of intermediate algorithm 
quantities used in the detection process. It is intended to help users gauge the quality of individual 
hotspot/fire pixels. Confidence estimates range between 0 and 100%.
- `Std_confidence`: Standard deviation of estimated fire radiative power if available. The units are 
in megawatts.
- `Var_confidence`: Variance of estimated fire radiative power if available. The units are in megawatts.
- `Count`: Daily numbers of pixels for presumed vegetation fires with a confidence level of larger than 
75% for a given region. 
- `Replaced`: Indicates with an "R" whether the data has been replaced with higher quality data when 
available (usually with a 2-3 month lag). Replaced data has slightly higher quality but it is expected 
to be of very minor impact in this contest. Please note that most corrections in the replaced data are 
associated with the precise geolocation and the fire classification. Most notably there is no 
classification for the type of fire, which means that all fires are assumed to be vegetation fires. 
Comparing the data from 2005 to 2020 more than 98% of the fires were eventually classified to be 
presumed vegetation fires.  

The data was spatially averaged to the following seven regions in Australia:   

- New South Wales (NSW)  
- Northern Territory (NT)     
- Queensland (QL)   
- South Australia (SA)  
- Tasmania (TA)     
- Victoria (Vl)     
- Western Australia (WA)

:::

@fig-fire-area-hist shows the distribution of fires by the magnitude of the area affected, in kilometres 
squared. The mean fire size is 157.30km2, while the median is 48.58km2. Predictably, the frequency of fires 
decreased as their size increased. A few outlying cases with very high fire area can be observed. The 
distribution of fires across regions is shown in @fig-fire-region-bar, which indicates that Western Australia 
experiences the most fires, while Tasmania has the least. Two general groups can be observed: regions with 
increased fire prevalence (Western Australia, Queensland, Northern Territory, & New South Wales), and regions 
with significantly lower fire prevalence (Victoria, South Australia, & Tasmania).

![Fire Area by Region Over Time](../src/figures/lineplot.png){#fig-lineplot-time width=60%}

A scatterplot illustrating the area consumed by a single fire compared to fire brightness is shown in @fig-scatterplot. 
Points appear to be fairly normally distributed about the mean of `Mean_Brightness`, although the outlying points result 
in high kurtosis. This visualization shows that the majority of outlier points noted in @fig-fire-area-hist occurred 
in Western Australia. @fig-lineplot-time is a lineplot displaying the area consumed by fires each year in km2 by region. 
Despite our previous observation from @fig-fire-region-bar that a notable number of fires have occurred in New South 
Wales, @fig-lineplot-time indicates that the magnitude of the fires occurring in this region is not comparatively 
significant; i.e., there may be lots of fires, but they generally seem to be small fires that consume less area. This 
indicates that fire frequency alone is an insufficient predictor of fire severity.

## Analysis

A linear regression model was trained to predict the intensity of forest fires in Australia, measured by 
estimated total fire area (the column `Fire_area`), using the variables `Count`, `Mean_conf`, `Mean_brightness`, 
and `Mean_rad_pwr`. We opted to use a linear regression model due to its interpretability and the continuous nature 
of our target variable. Prior to fitting the model, the numeric variables were isolated and standardized so that the 
coefficients we obtained would not be influenced by scale differences in the variables. Only four of the eight potential 
predictor variables were used to train the model: non-numeric variables were eliminated, and then a correlation analysis 
(see @fig-corr-matrix) was performed to identify which features present in the remaining data would be good predictors of 
the target variable. 

![Correlation Matrix](../src/figures/corr-matrix.png){#fig-corr-matrix fig-align="left" width=80%}

The data was divided into training and test sets using an 80/20 split. The model was first trained on 
the training data, and then used to make predictions on the test set. This analysis was performed 
using the Python Programming Language [@Python] and the following Python packages: requests [@requests],
zipfile [@zipfile], numpy [@harris2020], Pandas [@pandas], matplotlib [@hunter2007], scikit-learn 
[@scikitlearn], and seaborn [@seaborn].

# Results & Discussion

| Feature        | Coefficient         |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Count          | 2.0118368987260795  |
| Mean_conf      | -1.5121774092534443 |
| Mean_brightness| -1.5731199370335    |
| Mean_rad_pwr   | 0.4878341063053981  |

: Model Coefficients {#tbl-mod-coefs}

@tbl-mod-coefs presents the coefficients obtained from our model. A strong positive association is indicated 
between `Count` and `Fire_area`, while a moderate positive association is implied between `Mean_rad_pwr` and 
`Fire_area`. This suggests larger predicted fire areas correspond to both an increase in the number of fires 
and higher radiative power. Conversely, negative associations are evident between `Fire_area` and `Mean_conf`
(mean confidence) and `Mean_brightness`, indicating that increased confidence in fire detection and greater 
brightness of detected fires are associated with smaller predicted fire areas. This implies that fires with 
traits that make them more detectable tend to affect smaller geographic areas.

| Metric    | Value  |
|--------   |--------|
| RMSE      | 72.9543|
| R-squared | 0.9476 |

: Model Evaluation Metrics {#tbl-metrics}

We chose to evaluate our model using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which measures the difference between the 
actual observed values and the values predicted by a model, and R-squared, which indicates the proportion of 
variance in the target variable that is explained by a model's predictors. The evaluation metrics generated for
our model can be seen in @tbl-metrics. Good model fit was indicated by the scores obtained for the seleced model
metrics: an RMSE of 72.95 and  R-squared of 0.9476, respectively.

![Residual Plot](../src/figures/lineplot-pred.png){#fig-pred-plot}

![Line Plot](../src/figures/lineplot-resid.png){#fig-resid-plot}
:::

A strong positive linear relationship between the target variable and the predictors `Count` and `Mean_rad_pwr` 
can be observed in @fig-pred-plot and @fig-resid-plot, the line and residual plots accompanying the analysis. 
The predictors `Mean_brightness` and `Mean_conf` have negative coefficients, indicating a decrease in the value 
of these features precipitates an increase in the value of the target variable `Fire_area`.

The findings are consistent with our expectations, as regions with greater radiative power correlate with 
larger wildfire areas. However, the negative coefficient for `Mean_brightness` and `Mean_conf` suggests an 
inverse relationship, implying that lower brightness and confidence intervals are associated with larger 
fire areas.

The prediction model may have significant implications for wildfire management and prediction, aiding in the 
early detection and estimation of wildfire occurrences. This method can assist wildlife management services 
and authorities in better understanding the nature of wildfires. Integration of this approach can also help 
reduce risks posed by wildfires to ecosystems, communities, and public health.

For future iterations, it's worth considering further exploration of the correlation between mean estimated 
fire brightness and confidence, as this unexpected relationship may offer insights into underlying factors. 
Additionally, exploring other variables such as area, land characteristics, dryness, or the presence of old 
growth could provide valuable insights into their influence on wildfire occurrence.
